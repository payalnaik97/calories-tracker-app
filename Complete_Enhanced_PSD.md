### 15.4 Localization Technology Stack

#### 15.4.1 Frontend Internationalization

**React i18n Implementation**
```typescript
// Internationalization Setup
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';
import { formatNumber, formatDate, formatCurrency } from './utils/localization';

const CalorieEntry = () => {
  const { t, i18n } = useTranslation();
  const currentLocale = i18n.language;

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{t('calories.entry.title')}</h2>
      <p>{t('calories.total', { 
        count: formatNumber(2150, currentLocale),
        unit: t('units.calories')
      })}</p>
      <span>{formatDate(new Date(), currentLocale)}</span>
    </div>
  );
};

// Locale-specific number formatting
const formatCalories = (calories: number, locale: string): string => {
  const isMetric = getLocaleConfig(locale).measurementSystem === 'metric';
  if (isMetric && locale.startsWith('de')) {
    return `${calories.toLocaleString(locale)} Kalorien`;
  }
  return `${calories.toLocaleString(locale)} calories`;
};
```

  }

  @Get(':locale/food-database')
  async getLocalFoodDatabase(@Param('locale') locale: string) {

  }

  @Post(':locale/validate-content')
  async validateLocalizedContent(
    @Param('locale') locale: string,
    @Body() content: LocalizedContent
  ) {
    return await this.validationService.validateContent(content, locale);
  }
}

// Regional Configuration Management
